## Build from source 

This web-app made with parcel bunlder. To be able to build it from source code make sure to install parcel with following command:

```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Then run it as your local web application:

```bash
npm start
```

At this point you should be able to visit http://localhost:1234/ and see the game's web page.
